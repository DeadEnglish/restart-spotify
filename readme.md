# Restart Spotify
There's an unkown bug on Windows, I have no idea what it is with spotify but it keeps freezing and once you "close" it, it's not closed properly so you have to go in and close every process in task manager. I'm sick of it, so I've made this small script to kill and restart spotify.

Tweak it as necessary, if it crashes on Linux/OSX I'll make sure to add a new script for that.
